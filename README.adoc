= Lambdamatic: Managing data on MongoDB with Lambda Expressions

Lambdamatic is an open source Object-Document Mapper for MongoDB written in Java.

== Introduction

*Lambdamatic* is provides a *Stream-ish DSL* based on *Lambda expressions*
for managing data on MongoDB with a very high level of abstraction.

Under the cover, Lambdamatic analyses the _meaning_ of the user-defined Lambda Expressions
and converts them into BSON documents which are sent to the server by the MongoDB Java client.
The returned BSON documents are then converted back into domain objects by a
DocumentCodec that understands annotations defined on the domain classes (Ã  la JPA).

The strength of Lambdamatic is in its built-in support for Lambda Expressions to define how
data should be queried or updated. This core feature results in an *expressive* and *type-safe*
API for the users, who can focus on the _what_ rather than the _how_ of the operations
that should be performed on the datastore.

Lambdamatic also integrates smoothly with CDI to run in Java EE environments, as explained
in chapter 6 (CDI Integration).

== License

Lambdamatic is made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 which accompanies this distribution, and is available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html

== Status

Version 0.1 is coming soon (tm).

== Configuration

=== Requirements

Since Lambdamatic relies on Lambda Expressions, Java 8 is required.
Lambdamatic depends on ASM 5.0 and MongoDB Java Driver 3.1.

=== Maven settings

In your `pom.xml`, add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.lambdamatic</groupId>
  <artifactId>lambdamatic-mongodb-metadata-generator</artifactId>
  <version>${version.dependency.lambdamatic-mongodb}</version>
  <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
----

then, configure the following build plugins:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${version.plugin.compiler}</version>
  <configuration>
    <source>1.8</source>
    <target>1.8</target>
    <encoding>UTF-8</encoding>
    <compilerArgument>-proc:none</compilerArgument>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.bsc.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-processor-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.1.0-beta1</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>process</id>
      <goals>
        <goal>process</goal>
      </goals>
      <phase>generate-sources</phase>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
----

Once this is done, Eclipse users may want to install
https://github.com/jbosstools/m2e-apt[the m2e-apt plugin] to let the IDE invoke
the Lambdamatic Annotation Processor each time a domain class is saved.

=== MongoDB client configuration

*TODO*

== Document Mapping

=== Annotations

Domain classes must be annotated with `@Document` and their
fields with `@DocumentId` for the document id and optionally with
`@DocumentField` as follow:

[source,java]
----
package com.example.domain;

@Document(collection="bikestations")
public class BikeStation {

  @DocumentId
  private String id;

  @DocumentField
  private String stationName;

  @DocumentField(name="available")
  private int availableDocks;

  ...
}
----

if `@DocumentField` is missing, the class field is mapped to a document field
with the same name. The `@DocumentField` `name` attribute may be used to customize
the name of the field in the MongoDB document.

Embedded documents (also called 'sub-documents') must be annotated with
`@EmbeddedDocument`. The same rules for field annotations apply, except that
the `@DocumentId` should not be used.

A field annotated with `@TransientField` is not mapped and considered as `transient`
during the encoding and decoding phases.

From the class above, the Lambdamatic's annotation processor generates the following classes:

- `com.example.domain.QBikeStation`
- `com.example.domain.PBikeStation`
- `com.example.domain.UBikeStation`
- `com.example.domain.BikeStationCollection`
- `com.example.domain.BikeStationCollectionProducer`

These classes are located in the `target/generated-sources/apt` folder of your project.
The role of each of these classes will be explained in the following sections.

=== Supported data types

The following data types are supported by Lambdamatic:

- primitive types
- `java.lang.String` and `java.lang.Date`
- enumerations
- classes annotated with `@EmbeddedDocument` are mapped as BSON sub-documents
- `List`, `Set` of classes annotated with `@EmbeddedDocument` are mapped
  as BSON arrays of documents
- `Map` of classes annotated with `@EmbeddedDocument` are mapped
  as BSON arrays of documents indexed with a key (limited to `java.lang.String` or any number)

== Managing Documents in MongoDB

For each domin class annotated with `@Document`, a class with the same name and suffixed
with `Collection` is generated in the same package.
These 'Collection' classes are the entry points for manipulating documents on MongoDB.
They provide a fluent API somehow similar to the Java 8 `Stream` API even though the data
is processed on MongoDB rather than in-memory.

This fluent API provides support for inserting, querying with projections and updating
documents. Queries, projections and updates operations are described using `Predicate`
and `Consumer` arguments, yet the parameter type of these expressions is _not_ the domain class
itself but one of its generated sibling, prefixed with `Q` for queries,
`P` for projections and `U` for updates.
Using such a technique provides a well-defined API for each type of operation.

=== Creating Documents in MongoDB

==== Inserting

Inserting documents in MongoDB is done with the 

==== Upserting

MongoDB also provides an `upsert` operation, meaning that if a document with the same id
does not exist it is created, otherwise it is updated.

*TODO*

=== Querying Documents in MongoDB

==== Queries

Queries are written in the form of `Predicate`

Users can write queries as follow to find all `BikeStation` that are `IN_SERVICE`:

[source,java]
----
public List<BikeStation> findWithin(final List<Location> corners) {
  return bikeStationCollection.filter(
    s -> s.status == BikeStationStatus.IN_SERVICE
      && s.location.geoWithin(corners)).toList();
}
----

===== Operators

===== Geo-searching

More interestingly, you can leverage MongoDB's geosearch capabilities to find
all `BikeStation` that are `IN_SERVICE` and within a given area:

[source,java]
----
import org.lambdamatic.mongodb.types.geospatial.Location;
...

public List<BikeStation> findWithin(final Location[] corners) {
  return bikeStationCollection.filter(
      s -> s.status.equals(BikeStationStatus.IN_SERVICE)
           && s.location.geoWithin(corners)).toList();
}
----

The `Location` class is a special data-type provided by Lambdamatic. It is converted
into a custom BSON document or query document.

See the https://github.com/lambdamatic/lambdamatic-mongodb-citibikesnyc[NYC Bike Stations sample application] for more details.

===== Combining Operators


===== Queries on Collections

*TODO*

===== Queries on Maps

*TODO*


==== Projections

In some cases, users do not want to retrieve all the documents'fields from MongoDB,
but only the ones that need to be processed in the business layer or displayed in the UI.
Lambdamatic supports projection as well, using the following syntax:

[code,java]
----
import org.lambdamatic.mongodb.types.geospatial.Location;
import static org.lambdamatic.mongodb.Projection.include;
...

return bikeStationCollection.filter(s -> s.status.equals(BikeStationStatus.IN_SERVICE)
    && s.location.geoWithin(corners))
    .projection(s -> include(s.stationName, s.availableBikes, s.availableDocks))
    .toList();
----

The `projection` is defined by a second Lambda Expression where _all_ the fields to be included
or excluded are specified (all other fields including the `@DocumentId` are excluded or included, respectively).

===== Projections on Collections

*TODO*

===== Projections on Maps

This feature is not implemented yet.

=== Updating Documents in MongoDB

Lambdamatic supports operations to update documents. Contrarily to JPA whose `EntityManager'
handles transparently all the changes in the domain classes in the session, Lambdamatic provides
two ways to update data.

==== Full replacement

The first way is the full-replacement mode:

[source,java]
----
blogEntryCollection.replace(blogEntry);
----

In this case, the document whose `id` is the one given in `blogEntry` is
replaced with the given `blogEntry`. This is a _full_ replacement, meaning that all previous
fields are removed and replaced with the given ones.

==== Partial replacement

The second mode to update an existing document is by specifying the fields that need
to be updated and _how_ they need to be updated:

[source,java]
----
Date now = new Date();
blogEntryCollection.filter(e -> e.id.equals("1")).forEach(e -> {
      e.lastUpdate = now;
			e.commentsNumber++;
			e.comments.push(comment);
		});
----

 In the example above, the document in the `blogEntryCollection` whose `id` is `1`
 is updated in the following manner:

 - `lastUpdate` field is set to `now`,
 - `commentsNumber` field is incremented by `1`
 - the given `comment` sub-document is appended in the `comments` array.

==== Updating on Collections

*TODO*

==== Updating on Maps

This feature is not implemented yet.

== CDI Integration

As shown above, for each class annotated with `@Document` , Lambdamatic annotation
processor generates 5 classes including a CDI Producer:

[source,java]
----
@Generated(value="org.lambdamatic.mongodb.apt.DocumentAnnotationProcessor")
@ApplicationScoped
public class BikeStationCollectionProducer  {

   @Produces
   public BikeStationCollection getBikeStationCollection(final MongoClient mongoClient, final MongoClientConfiguration mongoClientConfiguration) {
   	return new BikeStationCollection(mongoClient, mongoClientConfiguration.getDatabaseName());
   }
}
----

This CDI Producer is named after the domain class (suffixed with `CollectionProducer`)
and is declared in the same package as the domain class.

With such a CDI Producer available, it suffice to annotate the generated `collection`
class with `@Inject` in a CDI bean to get accesss to the Lambdamatic type-safe API for
a give collection (ie, a type of document associated with a domain class):

[source,java]
----
@Singleton
@Startup
public class BikeStationsStorageService {

	@Inject
	private BikeStationCollection bikeStationCollection;

 ...
}
----
